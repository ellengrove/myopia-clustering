# unsupervised-learning-challenge

The objective of this analysis was to experiment with various clutering algorithms to determine whether a dataset containing descriptive information of patients with and without myopia could be divided into distinct patient clusters that could then be individually analyzed. The analysis utilizes dimensionality reduction in the form of a principal component anaysis (PCA) and t-SNE and then applies a k-means clustering analysis to label the reduced data into 5 clusters. Matplotlib was used for relevant visualizations.

### Data:
Myopia data found within "Data/myopia.csv".

### Technologies and Methods Used:
-Python
-Jupyter Notebook
-Matplotlib
-Skikitlearn (StandardScaler, PCA, TSNE, KMeans)
